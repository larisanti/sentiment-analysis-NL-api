# Sentiment Analysis Implementation with Natural Language API

This repository documents a hands-on lab completed as part of the Google Cloud "Analyze Sentiment with Natural Language API" Skill Badge quest. I used the Natural Language API to perform sentiment analysis and identify linguistic features in text, specifically applying it to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. The scripts for this lab were provided by the quest.

**What I Learned:**
* Google Natural Language API: How to use this API for text analysis, including sentiment scoring and understanding text structure.
* Google Apps Script: How to connect the Natural Language API with Google Docs for direct text analysis.
* Sentiment Analysis: Practiced classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
* Multilingual NLP: Explored the API's ability to process various languages.

### Analysis and Output Example

Below is a screenshot showing the sentiment analysis applied within Google Docs. It highlights text based on its emotional tone (green for positive, red for negative, and yellow for neutral sentiment).

This lab offered valuable hands-on experience. I realized, however, that sentiment analysis isn't ideal for deep dives into complex literary works like A Tale of Two Cities. Its strength truly lies in analyzing more direct, opinion-based texts. But this project definitely sparked my curiosity about NLP's broader real-world applications.
